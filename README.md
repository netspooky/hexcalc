# hexcalc
A simple hex calculator in the browser. I made this because there's other browser hex calculators but they all have ads and who knows what they do with the values you input.

Just clone this and open the file in your browser. Or just deploy it on your own host. Demo here: [https://n0.lol/hc/](https://n0.lol/hc/)
